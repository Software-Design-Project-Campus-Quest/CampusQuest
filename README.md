# NAVIGO
**Project Overview**
- NAVIGO is a location-based game for university students that encourages exploration through quests, treasure hunts and rewards. The application consists of:
  - **Frontend**: React.js + Tailwind CSS
  -  **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js
  -  **Database**: Firebase Firestore
  -  **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
  -  **External API**: Google Maps APi for location verification

- We are using the Agile and SCRUM Methodology.
    
**Repository Structure**
- The main branch is used to store backend and frontend code.
- The gh-pages branch is used to store build files which are compiled to run static files.
  - Our deployment to GitHub Pages and Azure is done from gh-pages branch.
    
- The other optional branches are for merge-pull requests for each contributor, where they will commit their own changes and wait for them to be reviewed.

**Testing Strategy**
- Unit Testing : Jest
- Integration Testing : Cypress
- API Testing : Postman
